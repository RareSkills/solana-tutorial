# Solana Sysvars Explained

![Solana Sysvars](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/935a00_b49fad623fe34f7598cfaf32c96e45f1~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1480,h_832,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/935a00_b49fad623fe34f7598cfaf32c96e45f1~mv2.jpg)

In Solana, sysvars are read-only system accounts that give Solana programs access to the blockchain state as well as network information. They are similar to Ethereum global variables, which also enable smart contracts to access network or blockchain state information, but they have unique public addresses like the Ethereum precompiles.

In Anchor programs, you can access sysvars in two ways: either by using the anchor's get method wrapper, or by treating it as an account in your `#[Derive(Accounts)]`, using its public address.

Not all sysvars support the `get` method, and some are deprecated (information on deprecation will be specified in this guide). For those sysvars that don't have a `get` method, we will access them using their public address.

+ **Clock:** Used for time-related operations like getting the current time or slot number.
+ **EpochSchedule:** Contains information about epoch scheduling, including the epoch for a particular slot.
+ **Rent:** Contains the rental rate and information like the minimum balance requirements to keep an account rent exempt.
+ **Fees:** Contains the fee calculator for the current slot. The fee calculator provides information on how many lamports are paid per signature in a Solana transaction.
+ **EpochRewards:** The EpochRewards sysvar holds a record of epoch rewards distribution in Solana, including block rewards and staking rewards.
+ **RecentBlockhashes:** Contains the active recent block hashes.
+ **SlotHashes:** Contains history of recent slot hashes.
+ **SlotHistory:** Holds an array of slots available during the most recent epoch in Solana, and it is updated every time a new slot is processed.
+ **StakeHistory:** maintains a record of stake activations and deactivations for the entire network on a per-epoch basis, which is updated at the beginning of each epoch.
+ **Instructions:** To get access to the serialized instructions that are part of the current transaction.
+ **LastRestartSlot:** Contains the slot number of the last restart (the last time Solana restarted ) or zero if none ever happened. If the Solana blockchain were to crash and restart, an application can use this information to determine if it should wait until things stabilize.

## Differentiating between Solana slots and blocks.
A slot is a window of time (about 400ms) where a designated leader can produce a block. A slot contains a block (the same kind of block on Ethereum, i.e a list of transactions). However, a slot might not contain a block if the block leader failed to produce a block during that slot. Their relationship is illustrated below:

![solana slots and blocks](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/935a00_fe2b8cf87b1849959603a835b8bcecc1~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1480,h_640,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/935a00_fe2b8cf87b1849959603a835b8bcecc1~mv2.jpg)

Although every block maps to exactly one slot, the block hash is not the same as the slot hash. This distinction is evident when clicking on a slot number in an explorer, it opens up the details of a block with a different hash.

Let's take an example from the image below from the Solana block explorer:
![solana slot hashes](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/935a00_52a0a8a9b7f044d4a191ffa571c7fc49~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1480,h_922,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/935a00_52a0a8a9b7f044d4a191ffa571c7fc49~mv2.png)

The highlighted <span style="color:Green">green number</span> in the image is the slot number **237240962**, and the highlighted <span style="color:#c1c146">yellow text</span> is the slot hash **DYFtWxEdLbos9E6SjZQCMq8z242Yv2bVoj6dzwskd5vZ**. The block hash highlighted in <span style="color:Red">red</span> below is **FzHwFHDAXJBc55rpjShznGCBnC7DsTCjxf3KKAk6hk9T**.

(Other block details are cropped out):
![solana blockhash](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/935a00_e29af689fdf141098fa7603bce44d797~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1480,h_354,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/935a00_e29af689fdf141098fa7603bce44d797~mv2.png)

We can distinguish between a block and a slot by their unique hashes, even though they have the same numbers.

As a test, click on any slot number in the explorer [here](https://explorer.solana.com/address/SysvarS1otHashes111111111111111111111111111/slot-hashes?cluster=testnet) and you will notice that a block page will open. This block will have a different hash from the slot hash.

## Accessing Solana Sysvars in Anchor, using the get method
As mentioned earlier, not all sysvars can be accessed using Anchor's `get` method. Sysvars such as Clock, EpochSchedule, and Rent can be accessed using this method.

While the Solana documentation includes Fees and EpochRewards as sysvars that can be accessed with the `get` method, these are deprecated in the latest version of Anchor. Therefore, they cannot be called using the `get` method in Anchor.

We will access and log the contents of all currently supported sysvars using the `get` method. To begin, we create a new Anchor project:
```bash
anchor init sysvars
cd sysvars
anchor build
```

### Clock sysvar
To utilize the Clock sysvar, we can invoke the `Clock::get()` (we did something similar in a previous tutorial) method as demonstrated below.

Add the following code in the initialize function of our project:
```rust
pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
    // Get the Clock sysvar
    let clock = Clock::get()?;

    msg!(
        "clock: {:?}",
        // Retrieve all the details of the Clock sysvar
        clock
    );

    Ok(())
}
```

Now, run the test on a local Solana node and check the log:
![solana epoch](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/935a00_1383139e135d4e39b3092482a762dfc4~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1480,h_92,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/935a00_1383139e135d4e39b3092482a762dfc4~mv2.png)

### EpochSchedule sysvar
An epoch in Solana is a period of time that is approximately two days long. SOL can only be staked or unstaked at the start of an epoch. If you stake (or unstake) SOL before the end of an epoch, the SOL is marked as "activating" or "deactivating" while waiting for the epoch to end.

Solana describes this more in their description of [delegating SOL](https://solana.com/id/staking#overview/delegation-timing-considerations).

We can access the EpochSchedule sysvar using the `get` method, similar to the Clock sysvar.

Update the initialize function with the following code:
```rust
pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
    // Get the Clock sysvar
    let clock = Clock::get()?;

    msg!(
        "clock: {:?}",
        // Retrieve all the details of the Clock sysvar
        clock
    );

    Ok(())
}
```

After running the test again, the following log will be generated:
![test output log](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/935a00_f4868db60a144483b36c24b700f934cb~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1480,h_66,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/935a00_f4868db60a144483b36c24b700f934cb~mv2.png)

From the log, we can observe that the EpochSchedule sysvar contains the following fields:
+ **slots_per_epoch** highlighted in <span style="color:#c1c146">yellow</span> holds the number of slots in each epoch, which is 432,000 slots here.
+ **leader_schedule_slot_offset** highlighted in <span style="color:Red">red</span> determines the timing for the next epoch's leader schedule (we had previously talked about this in day 11). It's also set to 432,000.
+ **warmup** highlighted in <span style="color:#8d28a4">purple</span> is a boolean that indicates whether Solana is in the warm-up phase. During this phase, epochs start smaller and gradually increase in size. This helps the network start smoothly after a reset or during its early days.
+ **first_normal_epoch** highlighted in <span style="color:Orange">orange</span> identifies the first epoch that can have its slot count, and first_normal_slot highlighted in blue is the slot that starts this epoch. In this case both are 0 (zero).

The reason we see the `first_normal_epoch` and `first_normal_slot` being 0 is because the test validator hasn't been running for two days. If we were to run this command on the mainnet (at time of writing), we would expect to see the `first_normal_epoch` being 576 and the `first_normal_slot` being 248,832,000.

![solana recent epoch](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/935a00_97b5517e14cb4e7ea783b18a25ed7e4d~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1480,h_802,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/935a00_97b5517e14cb4e7ea783b18a25ed7e4d~mv2.png)

### Rent sysvar
Once again, we use the `get` method to access the Rent sysvar.

We update the initialize function with the following code:
```rust
pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
    // Previous code...

    // Get the Rent sysvar
    let rent_var = Rent::get()?;
    msg!(
        "Rent {:?}",
        // Retrieve all the details of the Rent sysvar
        rent_var
    );

    Ok(())
}
```

Run the test, we get this log:
![solana rent sysvar](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/935a00_64286e1a2b93484a92a7cbc3839e545b~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1480,h_64,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/935a00_64286e1a2b93484a92a7cbc3839e545b~mv2.png)

The Rent sysvar in Solana has three key fields:
+ **lamports_per_byte_year**
+ **exemption_threshold**
+ **burn_percent**

The lamports_per_byte_year highlighted in <span style="color:#c1c146">yellow</span> indicates the number of lamports required per byte per year for rent exemption.

The exemption_threshold highlighted in <span style="color:Red">red</span> is a multiplier used to calculate the minimum balance needed for rent exemption. In this example, we see we need to pay $3480 \times 2 = 6960$ lamports per byte to create a new account.

50% of that is burned (burn_percent highlighted in <span style="color:#8d28a4">purple</span>) to manage Solana inflation.

The concept of "rent" will be fully explained in a later tutorial.

## Accessing Sysvars in Anchor Using Sysvar Public Address
For sysvars that don't support the `get` method, we can access them using their public addresses. Any exceptions to this will be specified.

### StakeHistory sysvar
Recall that we previously mentioned that this sysvar keeps a record of stake activations and deactivations for the entire network on a per-epoch basis. However, since we are running a local validator node, this sysvar will return empty data.

We will access this sysvar using its public address 
**SysvarStakeHistory1111111111111111111111111**.

First, we modify the `Initialize` account struct in our project as follows:
```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    /// CHECK:
    pub stake_history: AccountInfo<'info>, // We create an account for the StakeHistory sysvar
}
```

We ask the reader to treat the new syntax as boilerplate for now. The `/// CHECK:` and `AccountInfo` will be explained in a later tutorial. For the curious, the `<'info>` token is a [Rust lifetime](https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/lifetimes.html).

Next, we add the following code to the `initialize` function.

(The reference to the sysvar account will be passed in as part of the transaction in our test. The previous examples had them built into the Anchor framework).

```rust
pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
    // Previous code...

    // Accessing the StakeHistory sysvar
    // Create an array to store the StakeHistory account
    let arr = [ctx.accounts.stake_history.clone()];

    // Create an iterator for the array
    let accounts_iter = &mut arr.iter();

    // Get the next account info from the iterator (still StakeHistory)
    let sh_sysvar_info = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;

    // Create a StakeHistory instance from the account info
    let stake_history = StakeHistory::from_account_info(sh_sysvar_info)?;

    msg!("stake_history: {:?}", stake_history);

    Ok(())
}
```
We are not importing the StakeHistory sysvar because we can access it through the use of the `super::*; import`. If this is not the case, we will import the specific sysvar.

And update the test:
```rust
pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
    // Previous code...

    // Accessing the StakeHistory sysvar
    // Create an array to store the StakeHistory account
    let arr = [ctx.accounts.stake_history.clone()];

    // Create an iterator for the array
    let accounts_iter = &mut arr.iter();

    // Get the next account info from the iterator (still StakeHistory)
    let sh_sysvar_info = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;

    // Create a StakeHistory instance from the account info
    let stake_history = StakeHistory::from_account_info(sh_sysvar_info)?;

    msg!("stake_history: {:?}", stake_history);

    Ok(())
}
```

Now, we re-run our test:
![solana stake history](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/935a00_0729ba11d79245c6b2961b66dcab9279~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1480,h_64,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/935a00_0729ba11d79245c6b2961b66dcab9279~mv2.png)

Just as mentioned earlier, it returns empty data for our local validator.

We can also obtain the public key of the StakeHistory sysvar from the Anchor Typescript client by replacing our `StakeHistory_PublicKey` variable with `anchor.web3.SYSVAR_STAKE_HISTORY_PUBKEY`.

### RecentBlockhashes sysvar
How to access this sysvar was discussed in our [previous tutorial](https://www.rareskills.io/post/solana-clock). As a reminder, it is deprecated and support will be dropped.

### Fees sysvar
The Fees sysvar is also deprecated.

### Instruction sysvar
This sysvar can be used to access the serialized instructions of the current transaction, along with some metadata that are part of that transaction. We will demonstrate this below.

First, we update our imports:
```rust
#[program]
pub mod sysvars {
    use super::*;
    use anchor_lang::solana_program::sysvar::{instructions, fees::Fees, recent_blockhashes::RecentBlockhashes};
    // rest of the code
}
```
Next, we add the Instruction sysvar account to the `Initialize` account struct:
```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    /// CHECK:
    pub stake_history: AccountInfo<'info>, // We create an account for the StakeHistory sysvar
    /// CHECK:
    pub recent_blockhashes: AccountInfo<'info>,
    /// CHECK:
    pub instruction_sysvar: AccountInfo<'info>,
}
```
Now, modify the initialize function to accept a `number: u32` parameter and add the following code to the initialize function.
```rust
pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>, number: u32) -> Result<()> {
    // Previous code...

    // Get Instruction sysvar
    let arr = [ctx.accounts.instruction_sysvar.clone()];

    let account_info_iter = &mut arr.iter();

    let instructions_sysvar_account = next_account_info(account_info_iter)?;

    // Load the instruction details from the instruction sysvar account
    let instruction_details =
        instructions::load_instruction_at_checked(0, instructions_sysvar_account)?;

    msg!(
        "Instruction details of this transaction: {:?}",
        instruction_details
    );
    msg!("Number is: {}", number);

    Ok(())
}
```
In contrast to the previous sysvar, where we used `<sysvar_name>::from_account_info()` to retrieve the sysvar, in this case, we utilize the `load_instruction_at_checked()` method from the Instruction sysvar. This method requires the instruction data index (0 in this case) and the Instruction sysvar account as parameters.


Update the test:
```typescript
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Sysvars } from "../target/types/sysvars";

describe("sysvars", () => {
  // Configure the client to use the local cluster.
  anchor.setProvider(anchor.AnchorProvider.env());

  const program = anchor.workspace.Sysvars as Program<Sysvars>;

  // Create a StakeHistory PublicKey object
  const StakeHistory_PublicKey = new anchor.web3.PublicKey(
    "SysvarStakeHistory1111111111111111111111111"
  );

  it("Is initialized!", async () => {
    // Add your test here.
    const tx = await program.methods
      .initialize(3) // Call the initialze function with the number `3`
      .accounts({
        stakeHistory: StakeHistory_PublicKey, // pass the public key of StakeHistory sysvar to the list of accounts needed for the instruction
        recentBlockhashes: anchor.web3.SYSVAR_RECENT_BLOCKHASHES_PUBKEY, // pass the public key of RecentBlockhashes sysvar to the list of accounts needed for the instruction
        instructionSysvar: anchor.web3.SYSVAR_INSTRUCTIONS_PUBKEY, // Pass the public key of the Instruction sysvar to the list of accounts needed for the instruction
      })
      .rpc();
    console.log("Your transaction signature", tx);
  });
});
```
And run the test:
![solana sysvar instructions](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/935a00_7a761449386048b5926581b4bd55f2a8~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1480,h_110,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/935a00_7a761449386048b5926581b4bd55f2a8~mv2.png)

If we closely examine the log, we can see the program Id, the public key of the sysvar instruction, the serialized data, and other metadata.


We can also see the number `3` highlighted with the <span style="color:#c1c146">yellow</span> arrow in both the serialized instruction data and our own program log. The serialized data highlighted in red is a discriminator injected by Anchor (we can ignore that).

**Exercise:** Access the LastRestartSlot sysvar 


**SysvarLastRestartS1ot1111111111111111111111** using the method used above. Note that Anchor does not have the address for this sysvar, so you will need to create a PublicKey object.

## Solana Sysvars that cannot be accessed in the current version of Anchor.
In the current version of Anchor, it is not feasible to access certain sysvars. These sysvars include EpochRewards, SlotHistory, and SlotHashes. When attempting to access these sysvars, it results to an error.
